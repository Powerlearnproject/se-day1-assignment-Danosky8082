#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

software engineering is another  branch of computer science that helps in developing, testing and maintaining softwares. Trough the use of this key factors reliability which makes the software performs unequivocally and behaves unbiased to every task, scalability and flexibility so the software can handle any task assinged to it, security it proteccts every data and information through authorization, authentication and encryption and efficency that allows every user to maintain the quality of workflows.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. Mastering complexity
2. Mastering process
3. Mastering machine



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

 1. Planning - identify the purpose, problems, scopes and limits plus the software needed.
 2. Requirement analysis - identify the user specifications needed. 
3.  Design - building the framework. 
4.  Coding - the stage of putting the concepts into executable codes.
5.  Testing - checking the app for any bugs and glitches



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

1. Agile methodology - Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints). 
  - High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements. 
  - Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 
  - Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.


2. Waterfall methodology - Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on. 
  - there is Low flexibility
 - Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
 - Testing is done at the end of the development process.




Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

1.  Project Manager - basically make decisions on what will be made by gathering and presiding the software development team.
   - where discussions on the project and it's requirement are done.
   -  blueprints are designed for the project.
   - act as the go between the client and team monitoring and communicating neccessary information regarding the project milestone.
   - deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.



Software Developer basically does the how the sotware behaves by developing the applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
  - maintaining and updating software to keep it functional. 
  - collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.
  - reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.

Quality Assurance Engineer - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
 - set out a developmental template and procedures for the programmers to follow
 - established that the software meets the requirement before deployment. 
 - checks the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient. 
 - develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.

 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

An Integrated Development Enviroment IDE is a platform - software platform that facilitates and makes it easier for programmers to write, compile, execute and also troubleshoot codes for maximum functionalty. e.g like Pycharm, VSCode, Brackets etc

Version Control Systems (VCS) - are tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. like Git,
Advantage
 = Collaboration: Allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.
 - Change Tracking: Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification. 
 - Branching and Merging: Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.
 - Error Recovery: Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1, Continous upgrades of softwares which maintain that a software engineers should continue to improve their skills or risk becoming obselate.
2, Limited resources
3, Limited time or constraints
4, changing software requirement
5, software accessibilty this can be an issue if a user is struggling with a software due to complexity


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1. Unit tests - it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components by testing the modules each.
 
 2. Integration tests - check also that diverse modules used by the application work in symbiosis.
 - it enhance ease data flows between modules and interfaces work as expected.
   
 3. System testing -Focus on the entirety of the software system as a whole.
   -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional     requirements, including performance, usability, and security .

4.Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

- Prompt engineering  is the process where  a user guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
  importance
  1. improve user's experience and makes life much easier for the user
  2. Helps developers control the interaction between the AI and user to bring out a maximum and satisfactory results
  3. Helps developers create logical patterns that will enhace the performance of the tool 


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague: Create a login page 
Specific: Create a login page that checks if the age of the user is above 18

1. Specification in Details helps the tool zero in on the core of the request rather than speculate
2. Clariity reduce the ambiguity of the request
3. Concise reduce the time consume to get the best result
